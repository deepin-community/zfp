Description: Fixed-Rate Compressed Floating-Point Arrays
 This is a compressed format for representing multidimensional floating-point
 and integer arrays.  zfp provides compressed-array classes that support high
 throughput read and write random access to individual array elements. zfp
 also supports serial and parallel (OpenMP and CUDA) compression of whole
 arrays, e.g., for applications that read and write large data sets to and
 from disk.
